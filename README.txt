=================================================================
My implementation of the code is in:

	file_sys.h
	file_sys.cpp

/Tests/mk.tests is a script which will test functionality of the program

Each test consists of a:
	ysh file - input for the program to excute
	err file - output of any errors that occur during test
	out file - output of the program
	status file - error code (determined by exit command)
